#### demo:  https://cynthia1985.github.io/

## Technologies Used
# HTML
# CSS
# Vanilla JavaScript

## Concept
# When the user first gets to the page they have to guess the programming language word. The word is randomly chosen at the start of the game.

## Game Play
# To guess a letter the user clicks on any of the letters displayed. If the letter guessed is in the word, the letter shows up in the screen. If it is not there, a part of the hangman body will display and grows.

## Loser
# If the user runs out of guesses (6), the user will lose "You Lost". If they hit reset the page is refreshed and they will start a new game.

## Winner
# If the user guesses the word correctly before hangman is hung, a congratulatory message is displayed "You Won".

## Challenges
# Creating the alphabetic buttons from javaScript.
# Growing the Hangman using 6 differents images.
